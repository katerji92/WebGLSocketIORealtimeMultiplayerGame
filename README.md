# SocketIOPong
This is a very simple demo implementation of realtime multiplayer Pong using ByblonJS, Socket.IO. I'm developing this solution as I learn both frameworks from scratch.

The end result will be a pong game where 2 players can play against each other at a time and any number of users can connect and spectate the fiery match.
